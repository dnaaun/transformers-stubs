@dataclass
class BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for model's outputs that also contains a pooling of the last hidden states.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
        pooler_output (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, hidden_size)`):
            Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) further processed by a
            Linear layer and a Tanh activation function. The Linear layer weights are trained from the next sentence
            prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
        hidden_states (:obj:`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, `optional`, returned when ``output_hidden_states=True`` is passed or when ``config.output_hidden_states=True``):
            Tuple of :obj:`torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer)
            of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (:obj:`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, `optional`, returned when ``output_attentions=True`` is passed or when ``config.output_attentions=True``):
            Tuple of :obj:`torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape :obj:`(batch_size, num_heads,
            sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
        cross_attentions (:obj:`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, `optional`, returned when ``output_attentions=True`` and ``config.add_cross_attention=True`` is passed or when ``config.output_attentions=True``):
            Tuple of :obj:`torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape :obj:`(batch_size, num_heads,
            sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
            weighted average in the cross-attention heads.
        past_key_values (:obj:`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, `optional`, returned when ``use_cache=True`` is passed or when ``config.use_cache=True``):
            Tuple of :obj:`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length :obj:`config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors
            of shape :obj:`(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and optionally if
            ``config.is_encoder_decoder=True`` 2 additional tensors of shape :obj:`(batch_size, num_heads,
            encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
            ``config.is_encoder_decoder=True`` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see
            :obj:`past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
